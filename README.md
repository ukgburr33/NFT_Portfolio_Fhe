# Confidential NFT Portfolio: The Future of Secure Asset Management

Confidential NFT Portfolio is an advanced NFT portfolio management tool that revolutionizes the way users interact with their digital assets. Powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, this platform allows users to securely manage their NFT collections and provides a realistic valuation without compromising the privacy of their holdings.

## The Problem

In the rapidly evolving landscape of NFTs, asset management tools often fall short of ensuring user privacy while providing accurate, real-time valuation data. Many existing solutions require users to disclose sensitive information about their NFT holdings, exposing them to potential risks, including theft and market manipulation. Investors need a robust solution that allows them to track their collections and assess their value without jeopardizing their privacy.

## The FHE Solution

This is where Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) comes to the rescue. By leveraging Zama’s open-source libraries such as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**, our platform enables users to encrypt their NFT holdings seamlessly. The tool then utilizes advanced AI valuation models to compute the total worth of encrypted portfolios, ensuring that sensitive data remains confidential while providing necessary financial insights. This innovative approach preserves user anonymity and enhances the security of NFT investments.

## Key Features

- **FHE-Encrypted NFT List**: Users' NFT holdings are encrypted using FHE, ensuring that no sensitive information is disclosed.
- **Homomorphic Valuation Estimation**: The tool computes the total value of encrypted assets without decrypting them, safeguarding user privacy.
- **Whale Position Privacy Protection**: Designed specifically for high-value NFT holders, the tool maintains confidentiality for large asset holders.
- **Professional NFT Asset Management**: Offers advanced analytics and insights tailored for both casual and professional investors.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: An intuitive interface that simplifies portfolio management and visualization.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK**: The backbone of our encrypted computational capabilities.
- **Node.js**: For building scalable network applications.
- **Hardhat / Foundry**: Development environments for deploying smart contracts.
- **Solidity**: The programming language used for smart contract development.

## Directory Structure

Below is the directory structure of the Confidential NFT Portfolio project:

```
Confidential_NFT_Portfolio/
├── contracts/
│   ├── NFT_Portfolio_Fhe.sol
├── scripts/
│   ├── deploy.js
├── test/
│   ├── NFT_Portfolio_Fhe.test.js
└── package.json
```

## Installation Guide

To set up the Confidential NFT Portfolio project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine.
2. Download the project files (do not use `git clone`).
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will fetch all the required libraries, including Zama's FHE tools.

## Build & Run Guide

Once the installation is complete, you can build and run the project with the following commands:

1. To compile the smart contracts, execute:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. To run tests for your contracts, use:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
3. To deploy the contracts on a test network, run:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetwork
   ```

### Example Usage

Here’s a brief example illustrating how to encrypt and value NFT assets. This snippet shows how you might interact with the smart contract using JavaScript:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const NFTPortfolio = await ethers.getContractFactory("NFT_Portfolio_Fhe");
    const portfolio = await NFTPortfolio.deploy();

    await portfolio.deployed();
    console.log("NFT Portfolio deployed to:", portfolio.address);

    // Example of adding an NFT to the portfolio
    const encryptedNFT = await portfolio.addEncryptedNFT("0xNFTAddress", "EncryptedData");
    console.log("Encrypted NFT added:", encryptedNFT);

    // Valuing the portfolio
    const totalValue = await portfolio.getTotalValue();
    console.log("The total value of your encrypted NFT portfolio is:", totalValue);
}

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```
